# Allow internal traffic: Allow all traffic from the internal network to reach the root CA server. For example, if your internal network is 192.168.1.0/24, you can allow all traffic from this network with the following rule:
iptables -A INPUT -s 172.16.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
# Block external traffic: Block all incoming traffic from external IP addresses that are not part of the internal network. You can use the following rule to accomplish this:
iptables -A INPUT -j DROP
# Allow certificate-related traffic: Allow incoming and outgoing traffic on the ports used for certificate-related communication. For example, if you're using the HTTPS protocol for certificate authentication and management, you can allow incoming traffic on port 443 with the following rule:
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
